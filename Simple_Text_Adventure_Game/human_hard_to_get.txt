Ash: You choose to play hard to get. The human being has been begging you to text back. When you think she's gotten a bit too desperate, you finally reply. Weeks go by, but she gives no response. Did you take it too far? You hear the doorbell ring. The FBI are standing in front of your house, holding a picture of your human date. She had been kidnapped and YOU were the last person to be in contact with her. You grapple with the fact that you could have saved her. You're a real piece of work, huh?
