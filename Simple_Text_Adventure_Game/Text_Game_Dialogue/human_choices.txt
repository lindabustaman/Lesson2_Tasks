AI: You've selected a normal human being. What would you like to do on your date?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: You choose to confess your undying love. The human being begins to peel back her skin and reveals she is a horrifying bog hag. But hey! Knowing the fanfic you write, that's the least freakiest thing in your life.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: You choose to play hard to get. The human being has been begging you to text back. When you think she's gotten a bit too desperate, you finally reply. Weeks go by, but she gives no response. Did you take it too far? You hear the doorbell ring. The FBI are standing in front of your house, holding a picture of your human date. She had been kidnapped and YOU were the last person to be in contact with her. You grapple with the fact that you could have saved her. You're a real piece of work, huh?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: You choose to reveal your true self. The human being chooses to reveal her true self, too. You're taken aback when she peels off her skin to reveal she is a horrifying bog hag. But hey! Beauty is skin deep, anyways. On the other hand, she runs away in absolute horror upon seeing your face without makeup. Love is trash.
