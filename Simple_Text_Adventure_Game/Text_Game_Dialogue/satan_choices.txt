AI: You've selected Literally Satan. What would you like to do on your date?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: You choose to confess your undying love. Satan becomes super possessive, and by possessive, I mean he is having the time of his life wreaking havoc on Earth with your body. This guy does NOT know personal space. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: You choose to sell your soul. The love between you and Satan is hot - and by hot I mean you are stuck in LITERAL HELL. I would totally judge you right now, but it looks like God already did. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: You choose to read him your unholy fanfiction. The devil's expression changes from curiosity, to shock, to pure disgust, to abject horror. Satan ghosts you indefinitely, no matter how many sacrificial rituals you perform to bring him back. Congrats, you made the LITERAL KING OF HELL rethink his life choices. I guess Hell is not the only place where evil lives.
