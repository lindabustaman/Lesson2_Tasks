Ash: You choose to read him your unholy fanfiction. The devil's expression changes from curiosity, to shock, to pure disgust, to abject horror. Satan ghosts you indefinitely, no matter how many sacrificial rituals you perform to bring him back. Congrats, you made the LITERAL KING OF HELL rethink his life choices. I guess Hell is not the only place where evil lives.
