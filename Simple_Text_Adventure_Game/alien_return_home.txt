Ash: You choose to help the alien get back to his home planet. He thanks you profusely and departs. A few months later, he comes back with an army to destroy Earth and harvest its remains. Good job, you just doomed your the entire human race. Everyone is mad at you, but don't worry! They won't be around for much longer anyway!
